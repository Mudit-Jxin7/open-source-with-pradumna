  <summary><strong> How to get started with Open Source? </strong></summary>
  
  Steps:

- 1) Start with learning the basics of **Git** and **GitHub**. You can check out resources in, [Resources](Resources.md), [Bootcamp](Bootcamp.md), and [How to?](How-to/README.md).

- 2) Once you are familiar with the basics, start contributing to beginner-friendly projects to get familiar with the workflow and terminology of Open Source, Git, and GitHub. You can find some projects on the [Beginner Friendly Projects](Beginners.md) page. Also, contributing to your friend's project is a great way to get started.

- 3) Do join a community so that you can get help and guidance from the community members if you get stuck somewhere. I will recommend joining EddieHub Community on [Discord](http://discord.eddiehub.org/).

- 4) Once you are comfortable with the workflow, you can start contributing to Open Source projects depending on your interest, programming language, topics, etc. I will recommend starting with small projects and then moving on to bigger projects. Also, when you start with a project, first try solving and working on issues with the label `good first issue` and `first timers only`. This is a wonderful way to understand a project better and then move on to other issues. Also, I have written a Blog on [5 ways to find projects in Open Source](https://blog.pradumnasaraf.dev/5-ways-to-find-projects-in-open-source) you can check it out.
